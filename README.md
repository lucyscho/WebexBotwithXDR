# WebexBotwithXDR
Internal Hackathon 2023 Project- Webex Bot with Secure XDR Intergration
In light of the effectiveness of modern firewalls in preventing most phishing attempts, our project's focus was to address the human element of susceptibility to phishing attacks. We aimed to tackle this challenge by utilizing the Webex bot API in Python to automate the sending of phishing emails via the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). Our goal was to track the responses to these simulated emails, specifically identifying users who clicked on the enclosed links, and automatically direct users to preventative training.
To manage and present this data, we envisioned its integration into a concept XDR dashboard â€“ a user interface designed for advanced analysis. Within this dashboard, a dedicated phishing report section would empower administrators to gain valuable insights into the vulnerabilities and pain points associated with phishing attacks.
Administrators accessing this interface would benefit from a detailed breakdown of data, encompassing the success rates of different phishing scenarios, metrics on link clicks and email reads, as well as user accountabilities for any breaches. An innovative aspect of our approach is the subsequent engagement with users who clicked on the phishing links. In such instances, our Webex bot would automatically initiate compliance messaging and guide users towards resources for preventing future incidents.
While the absence of access to Cisco's SMTP server and the XDR sandbox environment posed limitations, we developed a low-level alternative for demonstration purposes, comprising the following steps:
* Employing a Google Form to collect data on user clicks and interactions.
* Utilizing the Pandas library to parse and organize data from the Google Form.
* Leveraging the Webex Teams API tailored for Python to orchestrate the delivery of compliance messages to Webex accounts of users targeted by our simulated phishing campaign.
